							<h2>Who am I?</h2>
						</header>

						<!-- Content -->
							<section id="content">
r>
								I am a MSc physics student at the University of Munich in Germany. 
								I am interested in the field of data science and data analysis. 
								My interests can be summarised in 4 categories:
								<ul>
									<li>Data Science;</li>
									<li>Theoretical Physics</li>
									<li>Software Engineering</li>
									<li>Traveling (I know very original)</li>
								</ul> 
								<hr />
								
								<p>
									<h2>Data science</h2>
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									My interested in data science began in my final year of my bachelors degree.
									Through the Erasmus+ scholarship I had the opportunity to visit the Catholic University of Leuven. Here I was introduced to Monte Carlo Simulations and its applications to statistical physics.
									Additionally, I studied applications of machine learning to solve equations in quantum many body physics.
									I deepened my knowledge in the application of artificial intelligence in the insurance sector while working for KPMG.
								</p>
								<p>
									I am currently studying as a graduate student in physics. Data science is a major part of my research. 
										Here I have explored applications of machine learning in fundamental physics.
										Through the merit based LMUexchange scholarship I studied data science and analytics in South Korea, with a focus on deep learning.
										Finally, I am currently working on my thesis at the Belle II experiment, a particle physics experiment designed to study the properties of B mesons. 
										Here I employ machine learning techniques to find ultra rare events.
								<p>

								<h2>Theoretical Physics</h2>
								<p>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									I started studying physics in 2016. Only in my third year I was able to specialise in theoretical 
									
									and computational physics. 
									
									Applying linear algebra and analysis to real world problems (such as Integrals and differential equations) 
									is one of my specialities. Here I finished in the top 1% of my class with over 400 students.
									For my bachelors thesis I completed some research in Quantum Field Theory. </p>
									<p>
									This gave me a good foundation to specialise in particle physics for my graduate studies. 
									Currently I am investigating events that were measured at the Belle II experiment that might lead to new physics beyond 
									the established standard model of today. New discoveries and scientific breakthroughs always excite me 
									and I am always looking for new ways to improve my understanding of the field.

							<h2>Software development</h2>
						<p>
						<span class="image right"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						Living in Korea, both of my roommates were computer science students. 
						Talking to them, I understood how important it is to be able to program in multiple different languages
						and that there are major benefits in understanding how exactly these work. 
						To help me better make sense of this, I decided to complete a few smaller projects with a variety of programming languages (mainly python, rust and C++).
						I have also switched from using Mac OS as my main operating system to Arch Linux. 
						This helped a tremendous amount in giving me a broad overview of how an operating systems actually works.
					</p>
					<p>
						While working on my masters thesis, this knowledge has already proofed to be essential for my research. 
						Every day I have to process an enormous amount of data which is impossible to do offline.
						The cloud service I use is run with RedHat. Scheduling jobs, requesting computational resources 
						and transferring data between multiple systems requires a deep knowledge of shell scripting and the Linux operating
						system in general. 

					</p>

							<h2>Traveling</h2>
						<p>
							I love traveling and exploring new places. I know, who doesn't like traveling.
							I have been and lived to many countries and I have visited many different cities.
							I enjoy active holiday where I can go surfing and climbing. Here is a small collection of montages I have created:
