									<p>My interested in data science began in my final year of my bachelors degree.
										Through the Erasmus+ scholarship I had the opportunity to visit the Catholic University of Leuven. Here I was introduced to Monte Carlo Simulations and its applications to statistical physics.
										Additionally, I studied applications of machine learning to solve equations in quantum many body physics.
										I deepened my knowledge in the application of artificial intelligence in the insurance sector while working for KPMG.

									<p>
										I am currently studying as a graduate student in physics. Data science is a major part of my research. 
										Here I have explored applications of machine learning in fundamental physics.
										Through the LMUexchange scholarship I studied data science and analytics in South Korea, with a focus on deep learning.
										Finally, I am currently working on my thesis at the Belle II experiment, a particle physics experiment designed to study the properties of B mesons. 
										Here I employ machine learning techniques to find ultra rare events.

								I started studying physics in 2016. Only in my third year I was able to specialise in theoretical 
								
								and computational physics. 
								
								For my bachelors thesis I completed some research in Quantum Field Theory. 
								This gave me a good foundation to specialise in particle physics for my graduate studies. 
								Currently I am investigating events that were measured at the Belle II experiment that might lead to new physics beyond 
								the established standard model of today.

						Living in Korea, both of my roommates were computer science students. 
						Talking to them, I understood how important it is to be able to program in multiple different languages
						and that there are major benefits in understanding how exactly these work. 
						To help me better make sense of this, I decided to complete a few smaller projects with a variety of programming languages (mainly python, rust and C++).
						I have also switched from using Mac OS as my main operating system to Arch Linux. 
						This helped a tremendous amount in giving me a broad overview of how an operating systems actually works.
